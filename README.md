# UnispectDMAPlugin

This is a plugin for Unispect!

## What can you do with it?
Read memory through your FPGA board without having to run Unispect on your main computer! It is as simple as that

## Important
- You need to have all the files from MemprocFS in the directory where Unispect.exe lies. You also need to have the FTDI driver dll in that directory (FTD3XX.dll)


### Have fun
